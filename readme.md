# Karma Tycoon

[Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/karmatycoon/) | [Bot](http://www.reddit.com/u/karma-tycoon/) | Thread (coming soon)

## How it'll work

It's So Meta, Even This Acronym

Like any tycoon game, there will be a currency. In this case, it's karma. You use karma to purchase post types (i.e. kitten pictures, reposts, sneaky referential comments, in-jokes) that will increase production of karma. Higher-level units (AMAs, test posts please ignore) will cost increasingly more karma and take longer to profit, though profits will be much larger. As upgrades are bought they will exponentially increase in price.

There will be a stickied thread on [/r/karmatycoon](http://www.reddit.com/r/karmatycoon/) which will serve as a way to see the current karma, upgrades, and instructions. Comments in this thread will be actions (buy 1 kitten-post, comment on niche-subreddit-thread, etc) that will influence upgrades and karma. The bot will reply to these comments, indicating whether the action was successful or not (if the cooldown time of a post hasn't finished, for example). The OP will be updated very regularly.

The rest of the subreddit is open to the public for discussion about the game, strategies and circle-jerks.

Users will have a flair that shows how much karma they have added to the total (through posts and comments) and also how much they have contributed to the karma-per-hour rate (through upgrades and unit purchases). They will be able to see these stats and the specific upgrades/units bought through a comment or message directed to the bot.

There will be no cap on the amount of karma, and more units will probably be added when the karma gets out of hand. Votes to reset the karma may be an option every once in a while.
